# üìä Data Analytics Mastery Repository

This repository serves as a comprehensive **learning log and portfolio** for my self-paced Data Analytics course. It contains all code, projects, and exploratory scripts developed as I learn and master core analytical tools and techniques.

**The goal** is to document my journey from foundational concepts to advanced model deployment, creating a tangible record of my skills and progress.

## üìö Course Syllabus & Topics Covered

This syllabus details the specific technologies and concepts covered in my learning journey. Each major topic will have a corresponding directory (e.g., `/01_Python_Fundamentals`).

### Section 1: Python for Data Analysis (The Analytical Toolkit)

* **Python Fundamentals:** Data Types, Control Flow, Functions.
* **Pandas:** DataFrames, Series, Indexing, Data Import/Export (`.csv`, `.xlsx`).
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing data (`NaN`), duplicate removal, type conversion, merging/joining DataFrames.
* **NumPy:** Array manipulation and vectorized operations.

### Section 2: Database Fundamentals (SQL)

* **SQL Basics:** `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`.
* **Advanced Queries:** `JOINs` (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT), Subqueries.
* **Data Aggregation:** `GROUP BY`, Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`), `HAVING`.

### Section 3: Data Exploration & Visualization

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Univariate and Bivariate analysis, outlier detection.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Creating line, bar, scatter, and box plots.
* **Advanced Visualizations:** Heatmaps, Pair Plots, Time Series plots.
* **Interactive Dashboards:** (e.g., using Plotly/Dash or Tableau).

### Section 4: Statistical & Predictive Modeling

* **Descriptive Statistics:** Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation.
* **Inferential Statistics:** Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA).
* **Linear Regression:** Simple and Multiple Regression.
